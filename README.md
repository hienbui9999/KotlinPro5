# Casper Dash build and test information logging
## Preparing steps
### Step1: Install package

#### Command: 

```
yarn install
```

#### Result:

```
warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
success Already up-to-date.
‚ú®  Done in 0.23s.
```

Note: The warning is generated by yarn, but it is not a problem. The file package_lock.json is used by npm to read the dependency tree and there is no problem to keep the yarn.lock and package-lock.json in the same project.
